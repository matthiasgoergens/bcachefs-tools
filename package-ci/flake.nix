  # Why this exists: the orchestrator binary, the shell scripts, the git
  # post-receive hook and the systemd unit were four separately-installed
  # things at four different vintages, with no mechanism to notice. On
  # 2026-08-09 that shipped a release into the wrong version namespace: a
  # binary was `cargo install`ed mid-build and never restarted, and a status
  # page patch written specifically to make the failure visible had never been
  # deployed at all. This makes them one closure that moves together or not at
  # all, and makes activation include the restart.
  #
  # The target (angband) is Debian, not NixOS, so there is no
  # `systemd.services.*`. deploy-rs's activate.custom is the seam - nix itself
  # deliberately has no on-target hooks, so anything touching /etc or systemd
  # belongs to the deployment layer. See ./doc/deploy.md.
