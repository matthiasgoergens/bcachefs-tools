# Last line of defence before users: a snapshot version must never enter the
# release suite.
#
# build-source.sh only emits '~' on its snapshot branch - a tagged build uses
# the tag verbatim - so '~' in a release publish means the source package was
# built before this commit was known to be a release, and the version is wrong
# no matter how correct the artifacts are. Worse, '~' sorts *below* nothing in
# Debian, so 1.39.0~2026... is lower than 1.39.0: the release publishes, looks
# successful, and is never offered to anyone already on the previous version.
#
# That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-09. The tag ref landed 9 seconds
# after the version was stamped; the build was correct as a snapshot and got
# reclassified 42 minutes later at publish time. Nobody found out for a day.
#
# Refuse loudly instead. The fix is to rebuild the source package now that the
# tag exists - the binaries are all derived from it, so there is nothing here
# worth salvaging.

name <em>your</em> release codename (the snippet above fills it in from

above (e.g. <code>trixie</code>, <code>forky</code>, <code>plucky</code>,
<code>questing</code>, <code>resolute</code>); <code>unstable</code> is built
against Debian sid and its dependencies will often not be installable on
stable releases. If you previously configured this repo with

<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt.bcachefs.org.sources</code> and replace it
with your codename.</p>
