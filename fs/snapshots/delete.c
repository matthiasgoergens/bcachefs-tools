/*
 * Snapshot trees:
 *
 * A node in a snapshot tree references keys with that snapshot ID, and all keys
 * with ancestor snapshot IDs not overwritten by a descendent snapshot.
 *
 * When a subvolume is deleted, we now have dead and redundant snapshot nodes
 * that must be cleaned up.
 *
 * - Dead:
 *
 *   A snapshot node with no children, and without a subvolume pointing to it,
 *   is unreferenced and can be deleted
 *
 * - Redundant:
 *
 *   Interior snapshot nodes (nodes with children) are only referenced by their
 *   child snapshot nodes. An interior node with only one child is redundant; we
 *   can clean it up by moving all non-overwritten keys to the child snapshot
 *   and removing it from the snapshot tree.
 *
 * Snapshot node states:
 *
 * - WILL_DELETE: this doesn't need to be a separate state bit. Indicates a leaf
 *   node that's no longer referenced by a subvolume (bch_snapshot.subvol == 0),
 *   so it's pending deletion
 *
 * - NO_KEYS: We can't remove interior nodes from the snapshot tree at runtime,
 *   because that can require changing bch_snapshot.depth on arbitrarily many
 *   children, and we can't do that atomically.
 *
 *   So instead, at runtime we'll do the heavy lifting of removing all keys that
 *   reference that snapshot ID, leave it in a half dead state, and the next
 *   time we start up we'll remove it from the snapshot tree.
 *
 *   Technically, we could, because the codepaths where this matters use the
 *   RCU-protected snapshot table - but there's a lot of work that has to be
 *   done for deleting interior snapshot nodes; parent/child pointers need to be
 *   updated, skiplists need to be adjusted, and if we get any of this wrong
 *   things can and will go horrifically wrong.
 *
 *   But if we defer it until recovery, when we're not yet running multithreaded,
 *   we can also run the check_snapshots recovery pass afterwards, for extra
 *   safety.
