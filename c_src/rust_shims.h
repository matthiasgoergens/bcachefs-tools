/*
 * Block device ioctl numbers, for Rust.
 *
 * These encode the direction bits and sizeof() of the argument type, both of
 * which vary by architecture and word size, so they can't be written down -
 * they have to come from the kernel headers for the target.
 *
 * Taking them as bindgen macros meant going through clang_macro_fallback, which
 * compiles a throwaway probe per macro and never checks whether the probe
 * compiled: reparse() looks at CXErrorCode, which says whether the reparse ran
 * rather than whether the code was valid, and nothing reads the diagnostics.
 * Both ways that can go wrong turned up in the field in the same week - one
 * build dropped BLKGETSIZE64 and failed at the use site, another kept it with
 * the size field 1 instead of 8 and shipped a binary that sent the kernel an
 * ioctl it answered with ENOTTY, partway through a device resize.
 *
 * So don't ask bindgen to evaluate these. Evaluate them the way everything else
 * here gets evaluated - by the C compiler, against the real headers - and hand
 * Rust a plain integer. Note that nothing below restates what _IO() and _IOR()
 * mean, which is the other trap: an open-coded 0x127E for BLKROTATIONAL is
 * correct on exactly the architectures whose _IOC layout you had in mind.
