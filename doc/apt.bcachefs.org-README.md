Stable channel:
`Suites: bcachefs-tools-release`

Snapshot/nightly channel:
`Suites: bcachefs-tools-snapshot`

If you want to ensure that the packages from this repository are always preferred, do:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/preferences.d
sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/apt.bcachefs.org.pref > /dev/null <<EOF
Package: *
Pin: origin apt.bcachefs.org
Pin-Priority: 1000
EOF
```

> **_NOTE:_**
Note that yes, you should always prefer `Pin: origin <hostname>`,
over `Pin: release o=<origin>`, because pinning by origin
will *actually* pin by the full hostname of APT repository,
whereas any repository can claim anything in it's `Origin: ` field,
and thus pinning by origin label is inherently insecure!
